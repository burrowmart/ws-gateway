/**
 * Identity guard — extraction and propagation only, deliberately WITHOUT
 * signature verification (ADR: ARCHITECTURE.md "Auth & Authz").
 *
 * Authentication lives at the trust boundary, not in every service: the
 * Cloudflare OAuth worker validates the id_token at the edge, and each pod's
 * Envoy PEP sidecar re-verifies the signature via OPA ext_authz before a
 * request reaches this container. The cluster has no public inbound
 * (Cloudflare Tunnel only), so a request arriving here has already been
 * cryptographically checked — verifying a third time in-process was pure
 * overhead. Accepted trade-off: identity headers CAN be forged by an
 * in-cluster caller; anything inside the private cluster is trusted by the
 * platform's threat model, and every hop still passes the callee's own PEP.
 *
 * What the guard does:
 *  1. Resolves the caller — x-user-email / x-user-roles headers when an
 *     upstream service already resolved them, else the JWT payload decoded
 *     without verification.
 *  2. Exposes the result as req.claims (for @Claims()).
 *  3. Stamps x-user-email / x-user-roles onto req.headers so outbound calls
 *     (forwardAuthHeaders) propagate the resolved identity downstream —
 *     alongside the original bearer token, which the callee's Envoy PEP
 *     still requires for its own signature check.
